### Register a GitHub account
* <https://github.com>
* As student you can request an Education account: <br> <https://education.github.com>

It allows you to create private repositories (among other things)

###Install Git
* Tell Git your name:<br>
`git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"`
* Tell Git the email address that will be associated with your Git commits (should be the same one found in your email settings)<br>
`git config --global user.email "EMAIL"`
